# my_chess_probe

Introduction

I've started playing chess about 5 months ago with the chess.com site, and I've encountered the plateau rating of mine and got stuck there for a while. That's why this project is aiming to find the hamartia of my chess.com games. First of all, I've gathered the data with Selenium and Bs4 by scraping my profile and the all the Blitz and Rapid type games' reviews which are also evaluated by Stockfish except a few minority. The data included several variables like the ratings,accuracy of both,evaluations, moves, date, time, opening and result.
